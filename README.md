## Getting started

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone git@git.chalmers.se:courses/dit342/group-00-web.git

# Change into the directory
cd group-00-web

# Setup backend
cd server && npm install
npm run dev

# Setup frontend
cd client && npm install
npm run serve
```

> Check out the detailed instructions for [backend](./server/README.md) and [frontend](./client/README.md).

## Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

Open the `server` and `client` in separate VSCode workspaces or open the combined [backend-frontend.code-workspace](./backend-frontend.code-workspace). Otherwise, workspace-specific settings don't work properly.

## System Definition (MS0)

### Purpose

The system is a platform where the users can interact, discuss and particularly review games. Other users can comment and give their opinion whether they agree, feel neutral, or disagree with the review. There is an administrator role for certain users to moderate content and add new games to the website, which other users can then review.

### Pages

* Login: This page displays a field where the user can enter their credentials to sign in. They are also given the option to be redirected to the “Sign up page” if they do not yet have an account.

* Sign up: The purpose of this page is to give an opportunity for a new user to create an account on the site so they can use it. It displays a field where they can enter their username and password.

* Home: This page shows a selection of games, reviews, and most recent activity from users they follow or from other users. The user can select certain elements to be redirected to the relevant page.

* Game: This page will display all the information about a specific game (such as its name, release date, and tags) and the reviews it has received by users. The user can create a new review for the game they are currently viewing.

* Profile: This page displays the specific user’s profile along with their bio, people they follow, and reviews. Each user has their own profile page and other users can follow them on this page. 

* Review: This page displays a specific review written by an user. It allows other users to comment on that specific review.
